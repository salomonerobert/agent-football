"""
Football MCP Server
====================

A small Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that the individual player agents
connect to (over stdio) so they can report their own condition during a match.

Exposed tools:
  - report_injury(role, severity)     -> log an injury for a role
  - request_substitution(role, reason)-> log a substitution request for a role

Both tools append an entry to:
  frontend/public/player_state/substitutions.json

The frontend already serves and polls that directory, so the browser picks the
entry up on its next poll and shows a top-right notification toast. There is no
roster/gameplay change for now -- this is notification-only.
